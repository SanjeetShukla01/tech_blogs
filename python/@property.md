Python setters method signature

he setter method (my_property) takes only one parameter (value), which represents the value to be assigned to the property.



```python
def setter(self, value):
    # set logic
    pass
```
    

self can take only one parameter because setters used to set value like obj.setter = val
So setters can't have more than one parameter in method signature.
