# Installing and Packaging python requirements:
### Why do I need to package requirements? Isn't installing sufficient?



Installing requirements directly is indeed a common practice, and in many scenarios, it's sufficient for managing dependencies in a Python project. However, packaging requirements into a format like ZIP or a wheel file can offer certain advantages, especially in certain deployment or distribution scenarios. Here are some reasons why packaging requirements might be beneficial:

### Offline Installations:

Packaging requirements allows you to create a self-contained archive with all the necessary dependencies. This can be useful when deploying in an environment with limited or no internet access. You can carry the packaged requirements and install them offline.

### Reproducibility:
By packaging requirements into a ZIP file or another format, you capture the specific versions of the dependencies at the time of packaging. This ensures reproducibility, meaning you can recreate the exact environment even if the internet is not available or the dependencies' versions have changed.

### Reduced Download Time:
When deploying in an environment with multiple instances or nodes, packaging requirements can reduce download times. Instead of each instance independently downloading dependencies, you can distribute the packaged requirements to all instances, saving bandwidth and time.

### Isolation:
Packaging requirements can help create an isolated environment for your application. It encapsulates the dependencies within a single archive, reducing the chances of conflicts with other installed packages or system dependencies.

### Custom Distribution:
If you need to distribute your application to others, packaging requirements simplifies the distribution process. Users can install your application with its dependencies by extracting the packaged requirements.

### Integration with Package Managers:
Some deployment tools or package managers may have built-in support for installing dependencies from archives. Packaging requirements allows you to leverage these features.

**Summary:**

While packaging requirements provides these benefits, it's important to note that it introduces additional steps in your deployment process. The choice between directly installing requirements and packaging them depends on your specific use case, deployment environment, and any constraints or requirements you may have.
