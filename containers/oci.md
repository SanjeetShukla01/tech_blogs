# What is OCI?

OCI (Open Container Initiative) is an open-source project created to establish industry standards for container 
formats and runtime. It was initiated by Docker in 2015 and is now governed by the Linux Foundation. 
The primary goal of OCI is to ensure compatibility and interoperability between different container technologies.

Key components of OCI include:

Image Specification: This defines the format for container images, including metadata, layers, and filesystem layouts. 
The image specification ensures that container images can be created, shared, and executed consistently across different 
container runtimes.

Runtime Specification: This defines the standard for container runtimes, including how containers are executed and managed. 
The runtime specification ensures that containerized applications behave predictably regardless of the underlying runtime 
environment.

By standardizing container formats and runtimes, OCI aims to promote portability, interoperability, and innovation 
within the container ecosystem. It allows developers and organizations to build and deploy containerized applications 
with confidence, knowing that they can run consistently across different environments and platforms. Additionally, 
OCI helps to prevent vendor lock-in by providing a common set of standards that multiple container technologies can 
adhere to.
