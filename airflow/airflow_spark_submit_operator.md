# How to run/orchestrate spark job in airflow? Do I need to create connection in airflow pointing to spark node?
Apache Airflow can orchestrate the execution of Spark jobs, but it doesn't inherently execute Spark jobs itself. 
Instead, Airflow typically interacts with an external Spark cluster manager such as Apache YARN, Apache Mesos, 
or Apache Spark Standalone.

Here's how the process typically works:

1. **Define a Spark Job as a Task:** In Airflow, you define a Spark job as a task in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 
This task represents the Spark job you want to run.


2. **Use an Operator to Execute Spark Job:** Airflow provides operators, such as the SparkSubmitOperator, specifically 
designed for executing Spark jobs. You configure this operator with the necessary parameters to submit the Spark job 
to your Spark cluster manager.


3. **Configuring the SparkSubmitOperator:** When using the SparkSubmitOperator, you'll typically specify parameters 
like the Spark application JAR file, Spark application arguments, Spark master URL, and any other relevant configurations.

4. **Connecting to Spark Cluster:** The Spark master URL provided in the operator configuration should point to your 
Spark cluster manager. Airflow doesn't run the Spark jobs itself; instead, it communicates with the Spark cluster 
manager to submit the job for execution.

5. **Airflow and Spark Integration:** Airflow does not inherently manage Spark clusters or require direct connections 
to Spark nodes. Instead, it interacts with the Spark cluster manager through its REST API or other supported 
communication channels.

6. **Monitoring and Managing Spark Jobs:** Airflow monitors the execution of Spark jobs through the Spark cluster 
manager's API. It tracks the job's status and updates the task status accordingly in the Airflow UI.

In summary, while using Airflow to run Spark jobs, you typically configure Airflow to submit Spark jobs to an existing 
Spark cluster managed by YARN, Mesos, or Spark Standalone. You don't need to create a separate connection in Airflow 
pointing to Spark nodes; instead, you provide the necessary configuration parameters in the Airflow DAG definition to 
connect to the Spark cluster manager.



To create an Apache Airflow DAG that runs a sample Spark application, you can follow these steps. 
Let's assume you have a Spark application packaged as a JAR file and stored in a shared volume accessible by both 
Airflow and Spark containers.

- **Create a DAG File:** First, create a Python file for your DAG. Let's name it spark_dag.py.

- **Import Airflow Libraries:** Import the necessary libraries from Apache Airflow.

- **Define Default Arguments:** Define default arguments for the DAG.

- **Instantiate DAG:** Create an instance of the DAG with a unique dag_id.

- **Define Task:** Define a task using the SparkSubmitOperator to submit your Spark application.

- **Set Task Dependencies:** Set dependencies between tasks if necessary.

- **Save DAG to Airflow:** Save the DAG to Airflow by adding it to the globals.

Here's an example of what the DAG file might look like:


```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.spark_submit_operator import SparkSubmitOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define default arguments
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

# Instantiate DAG
dag = DAG(
    dag_id='spark_sample_application',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False
)

# Define SparkSubmitOperator task
spark_task = SparkSubmitOperator(
    task_id='spark_job',
    application='/path/to/your/spark/job.jar',  # Path to your Spark application JAR file
    total_executor_cores='2',  # Number of executor cores
    executor_cores='1',  # Number of cores per executor
    executor_memory='2g',  # Memory per executor
    driver_memory='1g',  # Memory for Spark driver
    name='airflow-spark-job',  # Name of the Spark application
    verbose=True,
    application_args=['arg1', 'arg2'],  # Additional arguments for your Spark application
    dag=dag
)

# Set task dependencies if necessary
# For example, spark_task.set_upstream(other_task)

# Add DAG to Airflow globals
globals()['spark_sample_application'] = dag

```
